#Problem Statement 1:  Some complaints have been lodged by patients that they have been 
#prescribed hospital-exclusive medicine that they canâ€™t find elsewhere and facing problems due to that. Joshua, from the pharmacy
# management, wants to get a report of which pharmacies have prescribed hospital-exclusive medicines the most in 
#the years 2021 and 2022. Assist Joshua to generate the report so that
#the pharmacies who prescribe hospital-exclusive medicine more often are advised to avoid such practice if possible
